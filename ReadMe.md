# Summary
- This portfolio contains multiple projects that I have worked on and completed towards the end of my college career after I have developed the skills necessary to achieve results that show my ambition and technical ability to add value to advanced problems that exist in the current development of robots
- My expertise is in software, specifically related to the development of Deep Learning based systems designed for robot operation; however, there are a variety of projects that also demonstrate general software knowledge that can be extended to many other applications
- While my main background is in software, I certainly take interest in and have practical experience working hands on with computer hardware, electrical systems, 3D modeling and digital designs applications, and workshop machinery that gives me a strong interdisciplinary engineering breadth of knowledge

## Projects
- There are 2 main projects that show my current ability to apply Deep Learning Techniques to robots:
    - Perception Pipeline (a real time, camera only, computer vision pipeline for scene reconstruction)
    - Robot Controller (a real time model for controlling a bipedal robot for standing that was trained using reinforcement learning)
- There is 1 project that extends my software knowledge and 3D modeling software and game engine software to create simulations and both of the 2 Deep Learning applications make use of this project:
    - Simulation (an unreal engine 5 application that was used to create hyper-realistic simulations and physics based simulations that was used to train and test the 2 above projects)
- There is 1 project that combines my software ability with low level electrical systems and workshop machinery to create a functioning embedded system prototype
    - Drone (design, assembly, and manufacturing of a custom functioning drone prototype)
- There is 1 project that combines my software and forward kinematic knowledge with a pre-existing robotic arm to interface with the system and visualize the real world position of the robotic arm using DH parameters:
    - Robot Arm (serial communication with 3D mapping of the arm positioning in real time based only on servo angles)

## Demonstrations
- Link to view demos: https://1drv.ms/f/s!Am8UgeyMBo6ElXQLuiigCKk2_FLM
- IF FOR SOME REASON YOU RECIEVE AN ACCESS DENIED ERROR UPON LOGGING INTO YOUR MICROSOFT ACCOUNT, CLOSE THE TAB AND OPEN A NEW TAB WITH THIS LINK AGAIN AND IT WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS (REFRESHING WILL NOT FIX IT), no idea why this happens....
- These demos are contained on my personal drive so that you do not need to download anything, and can view all materials through a cloud version of Microsoft PowerPoint (if not viewing within Microsoft PowerPoint, the videos that are embedded within the presentation will not be able to play)
- Each project contains a demo presentation inside called "Demo <project name>.pptx" and each presentation contains brief overviews, descriptions, processes, designs, architectures, and most importantly, videos that showcase results (slides with videos are labeled with: (DEMO VIDEO))
- The drone is the only project without a video inside the demo (I did an in-person demo and forgot to record a video and the drone has already been dismantled and is being repurposed, sorry)

## Folders/Files
- There is a folder for each project described above within this repository containing code files in a variety of languages for veiwing purposes only
- Everything else in the project folders is associated with code files I have written or potentially are used by those files
- Unfortunately, Data for training, AI models, and runnable simulations these projects utilize have all been removed for upload to GitHub (data sizes are just too impractical to be uploaded, and the simulations are not packaged to a final application and would require extensive setup at the moment)
- All of these applications were created on my personal windows machine, across different languages and IDE's... if you do run some of these programs, do note that there can be massive performance differences depending on personal hardware
- It is not intended for any of these files to be run by you, they are merely meant to serve as a demonstration of my work; as mentioned in the Folders/Files section there is an included demo to view the projects in action
- If for some reason you would like to run some of these programs and need help setting them up, or you would like access to larger files that have not been uploaded here, or are interested in things like working with the simulation, please feel free to contact me at my email address and I can work with you to set these up on your own machine for your own use
